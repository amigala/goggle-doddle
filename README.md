# Doddle Topic

My doodle was an inspiration of combining my favorite animal, a panda, and turn it into a cartoon or a doddle. I created the panda doodle on Figma along with the little hearts on top of the head as well. I used mostly pastel colors to help provide this cute and playful theme throughout the doodle.
